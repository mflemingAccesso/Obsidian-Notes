# What do you see?

A 5 ft large bird humanoid. Jet black feathers with streaks of dark blue and violet through his plumage. Large ebony wings emanate a faint pink sheen throughout certain sections. They relax folded back a bit to where you can see his hands and large talons toward the mid segment. Yellow eyes with large black pupils. Long beak that shows signs of aging, slight cracks, dull marks that have worn over time. Commonly dressed, wears dyed leather garb (yellows and browns) with some makeshift utensils on his side belts, signs of flour claw prints throughout. A small chefs hat sits a top his head tilted to the side.

Upon closer inspection:

Wings
You see a couple singed feathers on his wings and across the left side of his face. Some look to be healing while others remain scarred.

Hat
Verbiage on the side of the tinier chef hat says:

# Backstory

## TLDR;

**Corvum** from **[[Humblewood]]**, raised in [[Winnowing Reach]] (simple town / outpost type setup) and spent most of his time helping locals, and travelers with lodgings and upkeep / maintenance of the lands. Fell through a portal while tending to lands and arrived in [[Faerun]] where he made a pact with [[Zylah]] who offered a way to return in exchange for utilizing his skill of identifying odd items.

Later settled down with another **Corvum** ([[Rexil]]) and had a daughter [[Aviray]]. Lost both of them in a house fire when my patron connection was severed. Returned to [[Zylah]] in [[Astrazalian]] looking for answers and had a period of atonement.

Returned to [[Humblewood]], moved to **Alderheart** to start anew. Started working at [[The Guilded Quill]] where he learned to cook and brew. Met [[Pip]] as a regular who later introduced [[Coda]]. He built a close friendship with them both. [[Pip]] mentioned the desire to adventure one day and he agreed thinking it was time to enter another phase of his life.

## Through the Looking Glass

Not much as far as his early life, raised near the outpost of [[Winnowing Reach]] where he met many travelers and helped locals.

One day helping tend some fencing on the outskirts of town along the forest he noticed a bizarrely misshaped tree. Further investigation merited he approached and as he was looking fell a bit too deep in between the twisted trunk. Tumbling for what seemed like minutes he was spat out of the same tree but the location was different.

He wandered for a bit searching for anyone to give him information about where he is. Eventually seeing a figure in the distance he lost focus on his feet and stumbled over something. He picked up what he now saw to be some sort of shiny trinket. Looking back up, the individual was gone. Glancing back to the object he peered a bit closer cocking his head as his brain seemed to absorb endless information about it.

A voice echoed in his head:

> Most wouldn't even know what they had their hands on, but you, your different.

Looking up to the individual, she introduces herself as [[Zylah]] while [[Silas]] is still uttering bits and pieces of random info about the item to himself.

**[[Zylah]]** immediately took note of this skill and began talking to **[[Silas]]** asking questions about where he's from, how he got here, introduced herself etc.

**[[Zylah]]** noted that she can help him get back to **[[Humblewood]]** whenever needed but would appreciate use of his strengths in exchange for power. The pact between them was formed.

He was sent on a variety of typical fetch / retrieve quests by **[[Zylah]]** picking up skills both useful and mundane and learning about different cultures outside of **[[Humblewood]]**. Traveling between the two planes became a monthly if not weekly occurrence as [[Silas]] took on his new role.

Eventually the requests ceased as **[[Zylah]]** became more distant.

With a lack of purpose **[[Silas]]** decided to settle down in his hometown sharing stories of his travels with travelers and villagers. This catches the attention of a fellow Corvum named [[Rexil]], they spend time with one another and eventually decide to live together and try for a family.

[[Silas]] and [[Rexil]] had no luck with children until one day an unhatched egg that we‚Äôd given up all hope on had an otherworldly visit where it was as of the light from the sun itself filled that egg and later began to hatch. This occurrence was thought to be folklore in the lands of [[Humblewood]] or utterings of those who worship Ardea but both [[Rexil]] and [[Silas]] swear by what they saw. A bit more time passes.

## The Incident

One night [[Silas]] stirred awake to the smell of smoke as ash tainted the thickened air. **[[Rexil]]** scrambled awake and immediately ran fetch our daughter [[Aviray]].

Checking on the rest of the den there were noticeable trails of soot debris and charred furniture still glowing red hot amidst the thick smoke.

Flames peaked out of multiple rooms as he got closer to where **[[Rexil]]** had ran to. He approached what he knew to be his newborn daughter's room as a large portion of roofing slammed down blocking the path in and out of the room.

Confident in his ability [[Silas]] charged forth making a barrier with his feathered wings in front of him. This time was different though, where normally he'd channel his magic in front of him for protection and hardiness in his feathers, this time he immediately felt the strong warmth of the fire. Running straight into the fallen wood some feathers began to singe as he reared back in pain. Catching his breath he tried again to no avail. He looked at his pale black wings as he felt the connection to [[Zylah]] had been severed. Nobody was answering, he was powerless.

<aside> üí°

[[Zylah]] separated from Shar in [[fortunate few]] battle at this exact moment.

</aside>

With no other alternatives, [[Silas]] looked on attempting to move chunks of lumber and debris as he could hear the faint cries of the remainder of his family stuck inside.

Eventually the cries subsided as the structure became unstable. [[Silas]] was forced to leave or be swallowed up himself.

Exiting the house he looked behind him as limb from limb began to tumble down feeding the flames beneath. Nothing was left. He found a restless night leading into the morning where neighbors began sorting through the debris to help. No traces of [[Rexil]] or [[Aviray]] were found, all that was left behind in the room were some stone childrens toys that [[Silas]] had found in his travels.

What felt like an endless week passed when [[Silas]] heard an echo in his head from a much gentler [[Zylah]]

> I'm sorry, I don't deserve forgiveness for any role I played in this but we can explain what happened if you meet me here. Return to the tree where we first met

I head to the tree I fell through the first time to see a similar situation. This time being guided through the transition gently rather than stumbling through chaotically.

## To [[Astrazalian]]

Arriving in an unfamiliar area I step out into what seems to be a newly developed plot of land. Pathways and segregated portions of land surround me as I peer out from around the corner of a nearby large shack.

An aroma draws me to the front where I see a myriad of tiny creatures gathered inside, like nothing I've ever seen before. Whimsical in nature, curious in alignment. For [[Silas]] It inspired a sense of what food and drink can do to build a community and permeate goodness to all.

I ask for a sample of whatever the special of the day is and receive a drink in a makeshift cup that delights the senses. Eased my mind and allowed me to collect my thoughts as I moved forward down a long path for what seemed like an hour.

Arriving at an the end, an impromptu train stop pops into view. I notice 2 guards wearing red and blue garb waiting for me. They welcome me into a passenger cart as we head towards the main city, as one guard says:

> Today is the day [[Zylah]] will be tried by the Panel of the Divine. We were sent to escort you there.

Trial happens, [[Zylah]] divulges bits of her past leading up to the corruption by Shar, what she remembers of her time with Shar, how ties were cut as the weave faltered, the [[Fortunate Few]], etc.

[[Silas]] spends a period of time in [[Astrazalian]] to ‚Äúseek purpose‚Äù and try to come to terms with why things went the way they did. Over this period of time (1-2 years):

1. Spends a solid chunk of time with [[Zylah]] to understand who she is now and comes to forgive her eventually although this creates a resentment towards the moon and the interference of God's in the mortal realm.
    1. [[Zylah]] assists in training and harnessing the tie that still exists between them albeit a bit weaker than it was before.
2. Seeks enlightenment at the Immaculate Temple, looks for answers on how to move forward, what to do with himself.
3. Helps out where he can here and there under [[Zylah]] wing,
4. Visits the shack near the portal in and learn from the creatures / individuals there. Assist in building some of it out in exchange for recipes and brews.

Eventually he decides it's time to move on feeling he's found what he was looking for and he says his goodbyes to all. Arrives back in [[Humblewood]] and decides to go to Alderheart after hearing many of the tiny creatures in the shack raving about how incredible it was.

## Moving to **Alderheart**

He started donated his time at a local city tavern **[[The Guilded Quill]]** in **Alderheart** _[The Great Tree City]_ practicing the craft and becoming familiar with locals where he eventually met **[[Pip]]** (**Mapach Druid** - Chris)

**[[Pip]]** would come in all the time telling of stories of his mothers new shop **Root and Roost** where **Wren** sells all sorts of variety from her garden.

- Never hesitates to create makeshift tools including a few cooking utensils of which I have several now on my belt.
- Makeshift Glider that he‚Äôs very proud of regardless of how well it works. Each time I drop a feather I give it to **[[Pip]]** to add to his glider hoping it may help in some way.
- Loves climbing tall trees, collecting trinkets, talking to new folks and adventuring
- From **Brackenmill** originally, moved to **Alderheart** when mother saved enough coin to open shop.
- Learned gardening and devotion to Hanera from mother, later learned the ways of druidcraft from a hedge named **Thist**

[[Pip]] later introduced another regular [[Coda]] who I became familiar with as well. This went on for some time talking to them or some of my travels until [[Pip]] started mentioning curiosity with some of the outside world.

## The Next Adventure

After living a decent chunk of time and getting to know the communal aspects of Alderheart [[Silas]] decides it‚Äôs time for the next chapter. Partnering with [[Pip]] and [[Coda]] we say our goodbyes as I promise Wren to look after them and we find help from a druidic shaper (Thistle) to send us on our way. Insert session 0 here

## [[The Guilded Quill]]

Local Tavern where I donate time and help manage, Owner saw my potential and offered a sort of blank slate to come and test new recipes and socialize.

Offers a variety of drinks and foods (mostly coffees and teas, herbals mixes) and to eat (mixtures of nuts, berries, and simpler dishes I‚Äôve learned to make)

- **A cozy, whimsical tavern with a rustic bar area and cooking quarters.** The bar counter is made of repurposed wood and tree branches, adding a touch of natural charm. The cooking quarters, visible through an arched doorway, feature a small hearth glowing warmly with a wood lit oven above.
- **The walls are adorned with mismatched, hand-painted tiles** depicting scenes of woodland creatures and birds in flight, creating a whimsical atmosphere.
- **The tavern features a scattering of small, round tables and chairs, some with cozy cushions,** providing comfortable seating for patrons of all sizes.
- **Sunlight streams through the windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air,** creating a magical, warm light.
- **The overall atmosphere is welcoming and intimate, perfect for smaller creatures and birdfolk.**
