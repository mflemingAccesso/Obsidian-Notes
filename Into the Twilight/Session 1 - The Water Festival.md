# Session Start

We‚Äôre staying at the Local inn called [[The Denhouse]]

Stirred awake by commotion outside people scurrying about.

We walk downstairs making our way to get a table and gather ourselves.

Gentleman behind the bar. [[Pip]] approaches meeting [[Henson]].

> [[Henson]] - Nothing prepped yet, food will be at the celebration - [[Henson]] (Barkeep). Everyone will be meeting in the town center first.

<aside> üí°

We only have 1 key to our room, [[Coda]] has it.

</aside>

[[Pip]] makes [[Henson]] a makeshift cup that holds liquid flawlessly as [[Henson]] pours a beer. [[Pip]] tries and hates it, [[Silas]] finishes it.

[[Henson]] mentions we should head outside towards the central fountain, we head out.

See a variety of homes from common to elegant and races from humans to half elves as we proceed through the rings of the city.

Eventually we see a made fountain, cracks showing aging but beautiful scene in general.

We see an individual in the center, long gray haired woman, braided as she welcomes and ushers us to the fire river to do the blessing of the sunrise.

We do yoga led by the older woman ([[Tara]]) and a similar looking younger woman, get some looks from the locals.

After yoga we meet the younger individual ([[Amarella]], [[Tara]]'s Daughter) - she walks around serving refreshments blueberry smoothies.

> Blessing of the flowers coming up in a couple hours. You should spend some time in the shopping district to pass the time.

## Shopping District

We head over, see an individual selling some trinkets at a makeshift table labeled ‚ÄúGadgets Gizmos and Grub‚Äù

[[Grug]] introduces himself and some of his inventions

1. Spoon of Stirring - Spoon that stirs slowly, hands free
2. Sneaky Knot - Shoelace that ties itself into knots when you‚Äôre not looking.
3. Stones of Affirmation - Whispers affirmations into your ear.
4. Warming Stones - Hand warmers.

As [[Grug]] is demoing a young man steals the sneaky knot while we look away. Running away he doesn't make it far someone trips him.

Walking up we see a Human male, looks very similar to Gaston named [[Jacosta]], Son of [[Jacosta]] (Hunter)

Thief being held up by one arm sees a large human male named [[Sigmar]] (Dan)

[[Amarella]] and [[Tara]] were pushed in the scuffle as a woman approaches investigating the disturbance, greets us as the town mayor [[Mila Mars]]

We're told about a pie baking contest, [[Drogon]] is in charge of sign ups

Odd interaction between [[Mila]] and [[Amarella]] ([[Amarella]] seems put down by [[Mila]]'s orders)

We see Grugs badger familiar emerge (Grub)

Members of the party all introduce ourselves to one another.

[[Grug]] closes down shop and decides to come with us, [[Jacosta]] asks for a moment of his time:

> What year is it? -[[Jacosta]] to [[Grug]]

Everyone is given a lilypad with a flower in case we want to make a wish and lay the flower in the fountain.

[[Sigmar]] steps into the pond and attempts to cast his wish directly to his gods via shouting into the sky. Makes a scene.

[[Tara]] steps over attempting to defuse, mentions the statue is of Eldath.

<aside> üí°

[[Sigmar]] mentions his gods are the Pantheon. He has a buffalo friend ‚ÄúJosh‚Äù

</aside>

We all cast our wishes.

[[Grug]] and I sign up to bake.

Baking competition - Make 3 identical pies for the judges, fruit based. It starts an hour later

[[Pip]], [[Coda]], [[Grug]], [[Jacosta]] and [[Sigmar]] sign up for the painting competition. Painting will be first, cooking second.

[[Jacosta]] and [[Sigmar]]/[[Pip]] get beer before the competition at a nearby tent.

7 Barrels

1. Seasonal Brew
2. Amber Pale Ale
3. IPA, Ellas Arcane Ale
4. Magic Carp
5. Mystic Mist
6. Sinister Shadow Shroom
7. Gobbling Goblin

[[Sigmar]] orders about 15 beers.

Different colors show how potent they are.

He passes them out, everyone bonds over a drinking chant.

[[Coda]] steps away in an attempt to learn more about Eldath from [[Tara]] and Amarello

<aside> üí°

Eldath

- Mother of the waters, mother guardian of groves
- Represents peace and water, avoids hostile actions. </aside>

## Cooking competition

Lemon Blueberry pie with an Alderheart Cap Cinnamon Crust.

Starts with a crust for all 3 pies rolling out some flour into a shape large enough to fill the tins. Sprinkles in a bit of spice and texture using some ground up caps from his own bag.

Blueberries, lemon juice and sugar a bit of gelatin to form the filling.

Takes the tops and places them adding lattice work on top with tiny slices in portions to show the blueberry filling beneath.

Lattice differs on all 3

- A Tree with twisting branches above and roots reaching beneath
- A simplistic Sun with a stork like figure flying inside it
- A Sea of flames

[[Grug]] and I sit at the same table.

[[Grug]]‚Äôs come out charred and he catapults them into the air narrowly missing [[Drogon]] on the descent.

I get 3rd place and 1 gold. Congrats from [[Drogon]] as he beckons me to try the baking festival in the Fall.
